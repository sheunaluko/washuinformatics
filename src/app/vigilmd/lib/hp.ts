HPI (History of present illness)  : This is several sentences/ up to 2-3 paragraphs which explain in more detail the initial presenting symptoms, and circumstances that led to the patient's current presentation to the hospital. It should elaborate to some extent on the nature, quality and duration of pain if present. It should include pertinent positive and negative findings related to the chief complaint.

4. Emergency department course : describes the presenting vital signs, labs, imaging, and other objective data obtained from the emergency department. It also includes any medications that were administered in the emergency department.

8. Assessment and plan : this section is the meat and potatoes of the note, in which the clinical impressions and plan are detailed for each problem. This section should include a list of diagnoses that start with the most important first. For each diagnosis an assessment is provided which explains the reasoning behind the diagnosis as well as the current status of the condition. Finally, each diagnosis also has a plan, which includes the currently treatment plan for the diagnosis.
